### 2. Technical SEO Issues

#### Critical: SPA Architecture
The website is built as a Single Page Application with content rendered client-side via JavaScript (`<div id="root"></div>`). While Google has improved SPA crawling, this architecture introduces:
- **Indexing delays**: Search engines must execute JavaScript before seeing content
- **Rendering budget concerns**: Relies on Google's rendering resources
- **Potential crawl failures**: Less sophisticated crawlers may miss content entirely

#### Missing Core Files
- **robots.txt**: Not present - needed to guide crawler behavior
- **sitemap.xml**: Not present - essential for indicating important pages and structure
- **Canonical tags**: Not implemented - important for preventing duplicate content issues

#### Schema Markup Gaps
No structured data detected. Recommended implementations:

**Priority 1: Organization Schema**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "Mobtronic LLC",
  "url": "https://mobtronic.org",
  "logo": "https://mobtronic.org/images/logo.png",
  "description": "Building infrastructure that amplifies human connection",
  "foundingDate": "2019",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "addressRegion": "FL",
    "addressCountry": "US"
  }
}
```

**Priority 2: Service Schema** (for each service)
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Service",
  "serviceType": "AI Infrastructure Consulting",
  "provider": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Mobtronic LLC"
  },
  "areaServed": "US",
  "description": "Cloud migrations, tenant consolidation, and SQL optimization for healthcare and financial services organizations"
}
```

**Opportunities:**

- **Content Depth**: Expand service descriptions with more detail
- **Call-to-Action**: Multiple CTAs present but could be more specific
- **Blog/Resources**: No content marketing or thought leadership section detected

### 4. Competitive Positioning

**Differentiation Strengths:**
- Human-centric positioning in technical space
- Specific healthcare focus (FHIR/TEFCA)
- Quantifiable results and social proof
- MIT CTO certification

**Recommendations:**
- Emphasize specialized healthcare IT expertise in title tags
- Create dedicated landing pages for each service area
